# data4PCCAR

An `R`-package containing a collection of data sets and 
`R`-functions to accompagny and complement:
Abdi, H., & Beaton, D. (to appear, 2019).
*Principal Component and Correspondence Analyses Using R*.
New York: Springer Verlag. 

In time, `data4PCCAR` will also contain the code used in the book 
and the resulting figures.

## Introduction

`data4PCCAR` is a collection of data sets and functions 
that are used (or could have been used, or should have been used) 
to illustrate Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 
Correspondence Analysis (CA), and related techniques 
such as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), 
and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS).

## Installation

To install `data4PCCAR` from `Github` 
use the function `install_github()`  
from the package `devtools`:

```{r}
#install.packages("devtools") 
#decomment the line above ifthe package devtools is not yet intalled
devtools::install_github("HerveAbdi/data4PCCAR") # install data4PCCAR
```


## Current data sets

### alcoholInEurope

The average consumption of 4 types of alcoholic beverages in 22 European countries and neighboring countries.
To be used to illustrate the use of CA and Hellinger analysis.

### colorsOfMusic

12 children and 10 adults picked up the color that best describes
each of 9 pieces of music.
To be used to illustrate CA and Partial Triadic CA (a variant of CA, a.k.a. PTCA).

### colorsOfVowels

133 (French) participants associated 6 colors to 6 vowels (data from Chastaing, 1961).
To be used to illustrate CA.

### deadInTheUSA

A contingency table storing the causes of death as a function of age in the USA in 2001.
To be used to illustrate CA.

### fiveBeersHedonics

Five tasters evaluated (using a 10 point rating scale)
how much they liked five beers.
To be used to illustrate how to use MCA with "fuzzy coding" with rating scales.

### foodInFrance

How much 12 typical French families spent on different types of food (including Wine!) in the 1950's.
To be used to illustrate non-normalized (a.k.a. covariance based) PCA.


### foodOfTheWorld

26 world cuisines are described by their cooking ingredients.
To be used to illustrate CA. 

### graduatingInUSA

A set of contingency tables showing the number of university graduates in the USA from 1966 to 2001 by fields.
The grand contingency table gives the The 34 years * 8 fields results. The partial contingency tables
subset the grand contigency table by gender (women vs men) and by levels (Bachelor, Master, and Ph.D.).
To  be used to illustrate CA, PTCA, and variations of these methods.

### mentalImageryOSIQ

A data set storing the (simulated) results of 2,100 participants 
answering a Likert scale like questionnaire comprising 30 questions 
about mental imagery 
(called the Object-Spatial Imagery Questionnaire: OSIQ). 
Half of the questions concern mental imagery for object 
and the other half ot the questions concern mental imagery 
for spatial locations.

### sixFaces

The (230 by 240 = 55,200 pixels) pictures of six faces (3 men and 3 women). To be used to illustrate PCA or PLS on images.

### sixAuthorsPunctuated

The punctuation used by 6 classical French Writers (Rousseau, Chateaubrian, Hugo, Zola, Proust, Giraudoux)
*plus* the punctuation of one chapter of Abdi's *Les RÃ©seaux de Neurones*. A classic example for CA.

### twentyWines

A baby example: 20 red wines (10 French, 10 American) are rated by an expert on multiple dimensions. Used to illustrate PCA.

### winesOf3Colors

36 wines (from Argentina, Canada, and the USA) are described by a variety of variables (descriptors, chemistry, and sensory). 
Used to illustrate PCA with supplementary variables (could also be used for two table methods such as CCCA and PLSC).

## Current functions 


### addArrows
Add arrows to a factorial map
(best with a circle of correlation as created, e.g., by `addCircleOfCor`).
Used for loadings for PCA maps.

### addCircleOfCor

Add a *Circle of Correlation* to a PCA-like map
#' of correlation produced by `{createFactorMap` 
*et alia.* Used for loadings for PCA maps.

### addLines4MCA

 a `ggplot2` based function that
adds lines to join the levels of
the qualitative variables in a factorial
 map of an MCA (e.g., computed with
`ExPosition::epMCA` and created with
 `createFactortMap`). Used for MCA maps.

### BinQuant

 creates (roughly) balanced
factors from quantitative variables.
Used to create nominal variables from
quantitative variables for MCA.

### boot.eigen

generates
a bootstrap distribution of eigenvalues
for a given (rectangular) matrix.

### Boot4PLSC 

creates a Bootstrap Cube for PLSC (partial least square correlation):
Creates Bootstrap Cubes for the I and J sets
of a PLSC
obtained from bootstraping the rows
of the two data-tables used for PLSC.

### buildRandomImage4PCA
 
makes a random image (with similar PCA loadings) 
 of a matrix of integer data such as Likert scales data.
 Uses two helper functions: `getRandomFS` and `recode2Integer`:
 
#### getRandomFS
generates multivariate random observations (i.e., factor scores)
    that match the variance/eigenvalues of the dimensions.
 
#### recode2Integer
recodes a vector of real values to integers matching 
    a given distribution for the integers.
 

### coloringLevels

 creates a vector of color names for the levels
 of an MCA from the color names of the variables.
 Used for creating mqps in MCA.


### compS

a helper function for the functions `perm4PLSC` and `Boot4PLSC`, computes the cross-product
of two comformable matrices using various types of normalization and centering.

### ctr4Variables

 computes contributions (or squared cosines)
for (qualitatitve)  variables from the contributions
of the levels of the qualitative variables.
Used to get contributions in MCA. 

### epVari

a Varimax rotation on loadings and factor scores.
Also gives the pseudo-eigenvalues and percentage of inertia.

### monteCarlo.eigen

a Monte Carlo generation of (random) eigenvalues to match
a data matrix. Use to implement the *parallel* test
for the number of reliable eigenvalues.

###  perm4PLSC
computes a permutation test for PLSC (as implemented
 in `TExPosition::tepPLS`.
Computes an omnibus permutation test and
specific tests for the eigenvalues when
performing a PLSC.

### phi2CT

a fast function to compute the $\phi^2$  correlation 
coefficient for a Contingency table.
Used for CA and MCA and
as a helper function
by function `phi2Mat4BurtTable`.
 
 
###  phi2Mat4BurtTable

computes the $\phi^2$ (correlation) matrix
and Burt table
for data tables suitable for
MCA. Useful to create correlation heatmap 
for MCA.
 A helper function,
 used for MCA.

### scale0

centers and normalizes a vector to norm 1 or to norm
$(N - 1)$.
`scale0` gives the same results as `scale`
except for the option `'SS1'` (`scale0` normalizes to 1); 
when `x`
comprises all identical values and when the
parameter `scale = TRUE`, `scale` gives back
a vector of `NaN` (because of a division by 0 error),
whereas `scale0` gives back a vector of `0`.
