\title{The similarity of 15 psychometric instruments 
measuring depression.}
\format{A list containing 2 data frames:
* \code{df.scaleSimilarity}:
a 15 * 15 matrix giving the similarity on a scale from 0 to 1000
between the scales (the similarity can be seen as akind
to a percentage 
of common variance rescaled from 0 to 1000).
* \code{supplementary.information}: a data frame with the
whole name of the scales 
and one factor variable indicating if he
scale is targeted toward adults
