\title{5 wines are described by
Sensory and Chemistry variables.}
\format{
A list with two matrices:
\itemize{
\item \code{Xmat.Chemistry} The chemistry properties (4 variables)
\item \code{Ymat.Sensory} The sensory properties (3 variables).
}
}
\usage{
data("fiveWines4Rotation")
}
\description{
\code{fiveWines4Rotation}:
wines are described by two blocks of variables:
Sensory and Chemistry.
}
\details{
The five (rather fictitious) wines
are described by two blocks
of variables corresponding (respectively) to
their  sensory and chemistry properties.
This data set has been used to illustrate (Varimax) rotation
for factor analytic methods and also in several papers
about Partial Least Square Regression.

rotations in factor analysis and PLSR. See, e.g.,
