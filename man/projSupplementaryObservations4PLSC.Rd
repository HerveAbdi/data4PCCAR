\arguments{
\item{mat4sup}{The observations to be projected}

\item{center_fixed}{The barycenter vector (i.e., mean)
used to center the original variables.}

\item{scale_fixed}{the normlizing vector
used to scale the original variables.}

used to project the supplementary observations on the 
variables (obtaiined from the original analysis).}
}

the supplementary latent variable values.

\description{
\code{projSupplementaryObservations4PLSC}
computes latent variables / factor scores for supplementary
observations in a \code{PLSC} analysis 
computed from \code{TExPosition::tepPLS}. 
\code{projSupplementaryObservations4PLSC}
preprocesses and projects supplementary observations for a PLSC
by first preprocessing the variables (i.e., centering and scaling)
and then projecting the preprocess observations 
onto the loadings (a.k.a., saliences) from the original analysis.
 \code{projSupplementaryObservations4PLSC} is mostly used
 as a preparatory step for
  \code{supplementaryObservations4PLSC}.
}
\details{
\code{projSupplementaryObservations4PLSC}
is mostly a subroutine of
\code{\link{supplementaryObservations4PLSC}}.
