\title{Computes pseudo Bootstrap ratios from pseudo-\eqn{F} for
variables in MCA.}
\usage{
BR4varMCA(BrLevels, wJ, nIter = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{BrLevels}{The bootstrap ratios  for the variables
(i.e., the output from \code{InPosition::epMCA.inference.battery}}

\item{wJ}{the masses (i.e. center of gravity of rows)
for the columns, typically obtained from
the output of \code{ExPosition} as
\code{wJ = 1 / resMCA$ExPosition.Data$W}.}

\item{nIter}{(Default: 1000) the number of bootstrapped iterations
used to compute the original Bootstrap ratios.}
}
\value{
A list with 6 elements
\itemize{
 \item{"pseudoBR.pos"}{The positive pseudo BR ratios (i.e.,
 BRs indicating \emph{differences} between levels)}
 \item{"pseudoBR"}{BR ratios matching the probability of their \eqn{F},
could be positive (indicating \emph{differences} between levels), or
could be negative (indicating \emph{similarities} between levels)
}
\item{F4Var}{The \eqn{F} from the ANOVA testing
the differences between the levels of
the qualitative variable.}
\item{df4Var}{The degrees of freedom for the \eqn{F}
from the ANOVA for the differences between the levels of
the qualitative variable.}
\item{ pF4Var}{Probability associated the \eqn{F}'s}.
}
}
\description{
\code{BR4varMCA}
 Computes pseudo Bootstrap ratios from pseudo-\eqn{F} for
variables in MCA.
}
\details{
The idea here is to get a statistics that
commensurable across designs. So, the BRs from the levels``
are re-combined to give a pseudo-\eqn{F}that tests
if the levels of the variables are reliably different
for a given factor,  the
probability associated to the pseudo\eqn{F}
is then used to compute a pseudo BR whose value
will then match the probability of the pseudo-\eqn{F}.
